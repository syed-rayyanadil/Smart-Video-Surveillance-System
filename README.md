<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<br>
In todayâ€™s world theft, crime and burglaries have gone to much extent, which causes 
damage in several aspects such as in banking, streets crime, shopping malls, 
educational institutes, housing societies and some others. Video Surveillance System 
provides an ultimate solution for such activities (specifically GUN detection), used 
for "Remote Video Monitoring" for the protection mainly against theft, burglaries, 
also "Loss prevention" to protect the assets, Public Safety: routinely used for streets, 
malls, communities, and neighborhoods to help deter crime and enhance public 
safety. Through surveillance cameras, crimes can be prevented from such 
happenings and cases could be solved with material evidence. For meeting the 
security objectives, cameras must be visible and must be able to record, store and 
transmit footage. In recent years, a great influence by deep learning in the field of 
machine learning especially in the object detection for classification, and CNN 
achieved great results in this respect.
In this project, we aim to detect the gun held by a person in the monitoring areas 
through cameras using Convolutional Neural Network and YOLO, and recognizing 
the face with the age classification of the person using some machine learning and 
deep learning algorithms such as FaceNet and AgeNet-Caffe Model, which produces 
great results in the real-time. 

<b>PROJECT OBJECTIVE</b>
<br>
The main concern of the project is the detection of guns and the person holding the 
in the premises of the monitoring area, also recognizing as known or unknown to the 
organization and it will be achieved by applying algorithms like You Only Look 
Once (YOLO) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). After successful 
detection of the gun held by a person, an alarm will be generated in that area and 
notification is sent to the relevant authority, which indicates an anomalous activity 
with respect to the gun detection happened in the monitoring area of the premises.
